I’ve recently been learning R and Python, and this webpage is a place to document my data science journey. While I did a lot of coding and modeling as a chemist, I did not formally learn about modeling and machine learning frameworks. (I wish I had! My post-doc would have been a lot smoother.)"

I am following the tutorials here:\nhttps://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/#where-you-should-start-changing-stuff\nhttps://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/\nGenerally, this process has been a nightmare. The website is being created within RStudio, then pushed to GitHub and published through GitHub pages. As I’ve made changes per the tutorial, I have repeatedly been unable to push changes to GitHub due to a variety of fatal errors and merge conflicts. Since I’m only working in a single place I have no idea where all these merge conflicts are arising from. I don’t understand how I can have everything in sync everywhere, make a local change, commit it, and then be unable to push it. I’ve had to delete the GitHub repository at least half a dozen times and recreate it from my local version because I couldn’t find any way to fix the conflicts and fatal errors. I’m not sure whose fault this is (Quarto, GitHub or RStudio). It could be my fault, but I really don’t understand why things are breaking so spectacularly. I’ve used git/ GitHub for version control of R projects before and I’ve never had an error. (I don’t really see how you can get a merge conflict if you are the only person working on a project and you are only working at a single location, but maybe I’m failing to envision some use case.)\nI decided to go with Quarto because it is now built-in to RStudio and the tutorials by Samantha Csik seemed very clear. (And to be fair, they are! Very easy to follow.) The tutorials I found for R Markdown to make a website seemed a little more involved and a little more kludgey.\nCouldn’t have done it without the best helper turtle in the world. Mac took a lot of executive naps to work on the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{e.sinks2023,\n  author = {Louise E.

Only 9 of the 49 variables are fully complete. The line comment token is only 0.110 complete and the has comments is only 0.144 complete. This variable has only 3 false values; it is likely that the missing data is skewed towards false. It is more likely that you’d complete this entry if there were a comment, than if there weren’t. It is also possible that the cleaning and prep done to prepare the #TidyTuesday dataset removed some entries which did have FALSE values for the comments.\nThere are some funny entries that appeared in the skim report, like -2000 as the year the earliest language appeared. It turns out this is Babylonian numerals, so it probably correct. This does show there is a lot more than computer languages in this dataset though.\nLooking through the variables, I see there is a “type” in the data dictionary, and it appears that “pl” means programming language. So let’s filter for that. (I couldn’t find an explanation of this variable on https://pldb.com/) It is used on various pages, but I couldn’t find the definition of the types.\nAlso, rank starts at 0, and I’d like it to start at 1.\n\nprogramming_lang <- languages %>%\n  filter(type == 'pl') %>%\n  select(-starts_with(\"github\"), -starts_with(\"wikipedia\"),\n         -description, -creators, -(website:semantic_scholar)) %>%\n  mutate(language_rank = language_rank + 1)\n\nskim(programming_lang)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nprogramming_lang\n\n\nNumber of rows\n3368\n\n\nNumber of columns\n16\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n6\n\n\nlogical\n4\n\n\nnumeric\n6\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\npldb_id\n0\n1.00\n1\n52\n0\n3368\n0\n\n\ntitle\n0\n1.00\n1\n54\n0\n3347\n0\n\n\ntype\n0\n1.00\n2\n2\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nline_comment_token\n3002\n0.11\n1\n3\n0\n18\n0\n\n\norigin_community\n883\n0.74\n3\n176\n0\n1825\n0\n\n\nfile_type\n2609\n0.23\n4\n4\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: logical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\ncount\n\n\n\n\nfeatures_has_comments\n2886\n0.14\n1.00\nTRU: 482\n\n\nfeatures_has_semantic_indentation\n2917\n0.13\n0.09\nFAL: 410, TRU: 41\n\n\nfeatures_has_line_comments\n2954\n0.12\n0.97\nTRU: 401, FAL: 13\n\n\nis_open_source\n2984\n0.11\n0.85\nTRU: 328, FAL: 56\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nappeared\n0\n1.00\n1994.16\n17.34\n1948\n1982.0\n1994.0\n2010.0\n2022\n▁▅▇▇▇\n\n\nlanguage_rank\n0\n1.00\n2296.75\n1249.08\n1\n1243.5\n2334.5\n3423.5\n4303\n▆▆▆▆▇\n\n\nlast_activity\n0\n1.00\n2002.04\n17.91\n1951\n1989.0\n2005.0\n2019.0\n2023\n▁▂▃▆▇\n\n\nnumber_of_users\n0\n1.00\n10793.85\n190197.19\n0\n0.0\n15.0\n165.0\n5962666\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nnumber_of_jobs\n0\n1.00\n160.22\n2692.65\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n85206\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\ncentral_package_repository_count\n939\n0.72\n0.00\n0.00\n0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0\n▁▁▇▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\nThis now produces a dataset with 0.143 completeness for features_has_comments.

It is a bit wall of text though. I wouldn’t recommend using this in reports, but it is a useful tool when doing your initial dataset analysis. (As a side note, I have noticed skimr doesn’t work well on Kaggle. It performs as expected if you are in interactive mode, but it fails when you try to save the notebook or run non-interactively.)\n\n\nStyling skim output with gt\nIf, for some reason, you did need to include output/ visualizations about missingness in a report, I’d probably recreate visualizations or tables by class of variable, especially if you have many variables, as I do here.\nHere’s an example for numeric variables, of which there are 24 in the dataset. First, we will skim the data and then use the gt package to style the resulting dataframe as a table. I used a built-in style, but each table element can be individually customized.\n\nlanguages_numeric <- languages %>%\n  select_if(is.numeric)\n\nlang_numeric_skim <- my_skim(languages_numeric)\n\nlang_numeric_skim %>%\n  select(-skim_type)   %>% \n  gt() %>%\n  cols_label(n_missing = \"# Missing\", complete_rate = \"Completeness\", \n             numeric.mean = \"Mean\", numeric.sd = \"Standard Deviation\",\n             numeric.p0 = \"Min\", numeric.p100 = \"Max\",\n             numeric.hist = \"Histogram\") %>%\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"blue\", add_row_striping = TRUE) %>%\n  tab_header(title = \"Summary of Numerical Variables in Languages\") \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Summary of Numerical Variables in Languages\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      skim_variable\n      # Missing\n      Completeness\n      Mean\n      Standard Deviation\n      Min\n      Max\n      Histogram\n    \n  \n  \n    appeared\n0\n1.0000000\n1.991105e+03\n1.114434e+02\n-2000\n2023\n▁▁▁▁▇\n    domain_name_registered\n3801\n0.1166628\n2.011333e+03\n7.021132e+00\n1990\n2023\n▁▃▃▇▆\n    isbndb\n3217\n0.2523821\n7.706262e+00\n3.316421e+01\n0\n400\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    book_count\n0\n1.0000000\n2.079479e+00\n1.734465e+01\n0\n401\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    semantic_scholar\n3545\n0.1761562\n3.794195e+00\n8.316231e+00\n0\n52\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    language_rank\n0\n1.0000000\n2.151000e+03\n1.242313e+03\n0\n4302\n▇▇▇▇▇\n    github_repo_stars\n3414\n0.2066000\n2.127403e+03\n7.554016e+03\n0\n88526\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    github_repo_forks\n3417\n0.2059029\n2.612867e+02\n1.203003e+03\n0\n23732\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    github_repo_updated\n3418\n0.2056705\n2.021390e+03\n1.763285e+00\n2012\n2023\n▁▁▁▁▇\n    github_repo_subscribers\n3418\n0.2056705\n6.234237e+01\n2.008820e+02\n0\n2910\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    github_repo_created\n3425\n0.2040437\n2.015843e+03\n3.479589e+00\n2006\n2022\n▁▅▇▇▇\n    github_repo_issues\n3518\n0.1824309\n1.230344e+02\n5.462553e+02\n0\n9522\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    github_repo_first_commit\n3567\n0.1710435\n2.014739e+03\n4.985409e+00\n1987\n2022\n▁▁▁▆▇\n    github_language_repos\n3833\n0.1092261\n1.971347e+05\n1.226901e+06\n0\n16046489\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    wikipedia_daily_page_views\n2837\n0.3406925\n2.271330e+02\n7.835524e+02\n-1\n13394\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    wikipedia_backlinks_count\n2877\n0.3313967\n3.185484e+02\n1.635289e+03\n1\n34348\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    wikipedia_page_id\n2893\n0.3276784\n9.167847e+06\n1.350683e+07\n928\n63063548\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    wikipedia_appeared\n2958\n0.3125726\n1.991144e+03\n1.702650e+01\n1830\n2019\n▁▁▁▃▇\n    wikipedia_created\n3040\n0.2935162\n2.005748e+03\n3.768240e+00\n2001\n2020\n▇▇▂▁▁\n    wikipedia_revision_count\n3130\n0.2726005\n3.304314e+02\n8.132556e+02\n1\n10104\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    last_activity\n0\n1.0000000\n2.000616e+03\n8.459776e+01\n-900\n2023\n▁▁▁▁▇\n    number_of_users\n0\n1.0000000\n1.377126e+04\n2.277129e+05\n0\n7179119\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    number_of_jobs\n0\n1.0000000\n4.221838e+02\n1.257299e+04\n0\n771996\n▇▁▁▁▁\n    central_package_repository_count\n1482\n0.6555891\n0.000000e+00\n0.000000e+00\n0\n0\n▁▁▇▁▁\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Missingness with visdat\nThe visdat package makes ggplot- compatible missingness plots.

It is used by many computer systems to determine the correct time based on location. To learn more, I recommend reading Daniel Rosehill’s article on the topic. For a drier history, check out the wikipedia article.\n\n# Get the Data\n\n# Read in with tidytuesdayR package \n# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest\n\n# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!\n\n#tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-03-21')\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 13)\n\ntransitions <- tuesdata$transitions\ntimezones <- tuesdata$timezones\ntimezone_countries <- tuesdata$timezone_countries\ncountries <- tuesdata$countries\n\nIt is suggested that we change the begin and end variables in transitions to datetimes.\n\ntransitions <- transitions %>%\n  mutate(begin = as_datetime(begin), end = as_datetime(end))\n\nI was interested in how many countries had multiple times zones.

This was unexpected, so say the least. I thought maybe there were some times zones for territories and perhaps military bases that I did not know about. I also thought there might be some extra time zones arising from some states using daylight savings time, while others in the same area might not. I wanted to visualize where these times zones were.\n\nUS_tz <- timezone_countries %>% \n  filter(country_code == \"US\") %>%\n  left_join(timezones)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(zone)`\n\n\nI found the lutz package created nice pictograms about when a timezone shifts from DST and back.

    "text": "I’ve recently been playing around with classification models, specifically on data sets with a skewed class distribution. In imbalanced classification problems, one class occurs infrequently. The minority class is often the class of interest (think fraudulent transaction, positive disease diagnosis, or intruder detection). Sometimes these applications are framed as a two-class classification problem, but other times they are called anomaly, outlier, or novelty detection.\nImbalanced classification problems are tricky for a couple of reasons. Models can achieve high accuracy by classifying everything as the dominant class. You can somewhat mitigate this problem by choosing models based on other metrics, such as sensitivity. You can also downsample the data to balance the classes (which throws out a lot of data) or upsample the infrequent class using a technique like SMOTE or ROSE to create synthetic data points.\nCollecting enough labeled data can also be expensive in highly imbalanced classes. Techniques like SMOTE won’t help if you only have 2 of a class in the dataset; the model needs “sufficient” data to learn from.\nAnother way to handle a minority class is to use a one-class classifier. One-class classifiers are one of the most widely used methods in anomaly detection because it does not require extensive labeled data for training. This method can either be semi-supervised, where only the normal (major) class is used for training, or unsupervised, where the method can handle anomalies in the training class. The one-class SVM is a popular implementation of one-class classifiers.\nHere I’m going to use a toy dataset from Datacamp. They have told me that all datasets used in their courses can be used outside Datacamp.\nI’m using some specialty packages here, specifically e1071 and caret for the machine learning."

    "text": "The best way to learn a programming language is to code. Obvious, but sometimes it can be daunting to start a project when you are a novice. Influenced by my time at a start-up, I’ve found the best approach is to create a minimum viable product. This is the smallest working part of the project. By continuing to revise and iterate the code, you can rapidly detect weaknesses in your knowledge and take active steps to fix them.\nMy learning project was a Wordle Guess Generator. I will show you how I used this project to create a self-guided learning plan. Motivated partly by my desire to have good guesses for Septle (a seven-letter guessing game), this project has been a crucial part of my journey to learn R. Practicing and learning coding skills were more important to me than devising the optimal strategy; if you are interested in “the best” Wordle strategy, then you will probably find much better answers by Googling.\nFor those who don’t know, Wordle is a word-guessing gamer that gives you five guesses to identify a 5-letter word. Correct letters are shown in green or yellow with each guess, depending on whether they are appropriately placed or not. Incorrect letters are shown in gray.\nI wasn’t interested in coming up with the global “best” answer. I wanted to come up with some guesses that fit my gameplay style. I guess three words in a row without trying to solve the game. Then, with a fair number of letters known, I attempt to solve the word.\nThe code has undergone several significant overhauls as I’ve needed to learn new things and used this project as the test bed. And here it is again, as a vehicle to learn quarto/ markdown. Here I will show you the very first ugly code and how I critiqued and revised it over several months. I’ve put it all on GitHub. The project is unstructured, the code is ugly, and all the versioning was by filename."

    "text": "1. Brainstorming the project.\nBrainstorm what you want this project to do. Try to have a very clear statement about the project’s goal at the top. If you can think of self-contained modules, mark that. If you can sketch out the scaffold of the code- great! If you have some ideas about the results, even better. Put everything you can think of down. I had been thinking about this project for a while, so this brainstorming sheet is neat. Neatness and organization are not important at this point; getting stuff written down is.\nMy goal was “I want 3 initial guesses for Septle. Ideally, I’ll maximize the number of unique letters, and I want to preferentially pick from the most frequently used letters.”\nI decided my scoring would be based on the frequency letters occur in English; more common letters get a higher score than uncommon letters. To generate the score for the word, I proposed the following process:\n\nRead in letter frequencies\nScoring [the letters, originally I thought it would be based on rank, with the most common letter getting a 26 and the least common getting a 1. That is what the confusing little sketch is attempting to convey. A is not the most common letter, nor is Z the least common.]\nRead in the list of words\nCalculate the scores [of the words]\nPick the best word as a first guess [best meaning highest scoring]\n\nI also talk about how the frequency distribution of letters will likely differ between five and seven-letter words. I suggested looking at the frequency of letters in modern text instead of just frequency lists from linguists. I noted that certain letters are more likely to be in a specific position, and it could be valuable to constrain the guess to typical positions. An example is that “y” is almost always at the end of a word in English, so “sadly” might be a better guess than “yacht” for that reason. You are likelier to lock down a letter with a positionally accurate guess. I also said that I wanted a 4th Wordle guess. There are a lot of ideas here! That’s okay because I winnow them down in the next step.\n\n\n\nThe initial brainstorming session"

I would size it so you can get working code to accomplish the goal in a few hours.\nI chose to generate four guesses for Wordle. I also decided to generate my frequency table from the word list itself. I found a five-letter word list that I could download and read in, but all the letter frequency tables I found were on blogs or in articles, and the only way I could see to get them into my program was to type them in and I was too lazy to do that.

Just get something running.\nThis first attempt took me 3-4 hours to write.\nI googled how to calculate the frequency of letters in words (in R) and found this helpful tutorial.\n\nThe Minimal Viable Product: Running Code\nI cleaned up the commenting/formatting of the initial code just for this post. I also added library(tidyverse)- apparently, I was just loading libraries through the gui back then. If you want to see the true initial version, it is on GitHub.\nHere’s what my MVP does:\n\nI found a list of five letter words online and imported it.\nI calculated how often each letter occurred over the word list.\n(This, or the scaled version, was the score assigned to each letter.)\nI looped through the word list and calculated two scores for each word, one using all letters and one using only the unique letters.\nI picked the highest-scoring word as my first guess.\nI then went through the word list and calculated a second score for the words minus the letters already guessed in the first guess (and ignoring duplicated letters).\nI picked the highest-scoring word as my second guess.\nI repeated steps 5 & 6 to pick a third guess.\n\nOkay, so let’s look at some bad code. I will flag a few things as we go through, but I’m certain you can find much more that is not optimal.\nHere’s loading the data and writing two scoring functions. I first wrote these in the code but had time to convert them to functions in this initial work session. It was an opportunity to practice function writing, but it was not critical to the minimum viable product.\nI have lots of print statements commented out; this is a very simple way to debug and see how you are proceeding through the code. There are more sophisticated tools in R Studio, but I didn’t want to figure out how to use them at this moment. I use the global variable char_frequencies for the value of each letter. I create this variable in the next code chunk.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nsgb.words <- \n  read.delim(\"C:/Users/drsin/OneDrive/Documents/R Projects/wordle/sgb-words.txt\",\n             sep = \"\")\n\n#probably want this instead because it assumes no headers\n#test6 <- read.table(file.choose())\n\nScoring_Word <- function(word){\n  #i'm not handling duplicate letters at all right now\n  letter_vec <-  unlist(strsplit(word, split = \"\"))\n  value <- 0\n  for (i in 1:5) {\n    position <- letter_vec[i] == char_frequencies$letters\n    value[i] <- y[position]\n   # print(i)\n    if (i == 5) {\n     # print(\"I am here\")\n     # print(sum(value))\n      return(total <- sum(value))\n      }\n    \n  }\n} \n\n\nScoring_Word_Unique <- function(word){\n\n # print(word)\n  letter_vec <-  unlist(strsplit(word, split = \"\"))\n  unique_letter_vec <- unique(letter_vec)\n  #print(unique_letter_vec)\n  #print(length(unique_letter_vec))\n  \n  value <- 0\n  if (length(unique_letter_vec) == 0) {\n    return(value)\n  } else{\n      for (i in 1:length(unique_letter_vec)) {\n      position <- unique_letter_vec[i] == char_frequencies$letters\n      value[i] <- y[position]\n    # print(i)\n    # print(value)\n    if (i == length(unique_letter_vec)) {\n      # print(\"I am here\")\n      # print(sum(value))\n      return(total <- sum(value))\n    }\n    \n  }\n  }\n}\n\nI did run through most of the code with five words initially, and then later the whole word list, when I was more confident that things worked.\nI calculate how often each letter appears in the list and create the scaled version. I created two incredibly ugly graphs: one of the raw counts for each letter and one of the scaled frequencies. This is also a moment to do a quick reality check on the results- are the most and least common letters what you’d expect?\n\nstart_time <- Sys.time()\n\nletters <- unlist(strsplit(sgb.words[,1], split = \"\"))\nchar_frequencies <- as.data.frame(table(letters))\n#char_frequencies\n\nggplot(char_frequencies, \n        aes(x = fct_reorder(char_frequencies[,1], char_frequencies[,2])\n                              , char_frequencies[,2] )) +\n   geom_col() +\n   theme_classic()\n\n\n\ncommon <- max(char_frequencies[,2])\ny = (char_frequencies[,2]/common)\n\nggplot(char_frequencies, \n       aes(x =  fct_reorder(char_frequencies[,1], char_frequencies[,2]), y )) +\n  geom_col() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\nNow I calculate the scores for the (hand-picked) words I’ve been playing with. I also hand-calculated these scores using the values from char_frequencies to ensure my scoring functions did what I thought they were.\nI initialized an object to store the words, scores, and guesses. You can also tell that I had no idea what data types my objects were since I called them a list. small_list is a matrix/array of characters, and none of my zeros are numbers. I wanted a dataframe, but I didn’t know how to do that. I didn’t have a strong reason to prefer a dataframe other than it was widely used in the courses I was taking at Datacamp.\nThis chunk also pulls out a single word and sends it to score to check that it works before I loop through the entire object and calculate all the scores.\nYou can also see I hard-coded the number of words (again… I did this in the prior code chunk too.)\n\n#calculate the score for crone\ncrone_score <- Scoring_Word(\"crone\")\n#might_score <- Scoring_Word (\"might\")\n#sadly_score <- Scoring_Word (\"sadly\")\nnum_words <- 5756\n#num_words <- 5\nsmall_list <- cbind(word_name = sgb.words[1:num_words,1], \n                    score =rep(0, times = num_words), \n                    unique_score = rep(0, times = num_words),\n                    post_word_one_unique = rep(0, times = num_words),\n                    post_word_two_unique = rep(0, times = num_words),\n                    post_word_three_unique = rep(0, times = num_words)\n                                                )\nword <- small_list[[1,1]]\nScoring_Word(word)\n\n[1] 3.40422\n\nind2 <- 0\n\nfor (ind2 in 1:num_words){\n  #print(small_list[[ind2,1]])\n  score_ind2 <- Scoring_Word(small_list[[ind2,1]])\n  small_list[[ind2,2]] <- score_ind2\n}\n\n#u_crone_score <- Scoring_Word_Unique(\"crone\")\n#u_there_core <- Scoring_Word_Unique (\"there\")\n#sadly_score <- Scoring_Word (\"sadly\")\n\nind2 <- 0\nfor (ind2 in 1:num_words){\n # print(small_list[[ind2,1]])\n  score_ind2 <- Scoring_Word_Unique(small_list[[ind2,1]])\n # print(score_ind2)\n  small_list[[ind2,3]] <- score_ind2\n}\n\nIn my attempt to sort the word scores and pick out the highest-scoring works, I created an unnecessary number of temporary variables. I forced one of these objects to be a dataframe, but I didn’t check the types of the individual components. Note that all my numbers are still characters. It is funny that things worked even though they were the wrong type.\n\nsmall_list1 <- small_list\nsmall_df <- as.data.frame(small_list1)\ntop_words <- small_df %>%\n arrange(desc(unique_score))\n\nword_1 <- top_words$word_name[1]\n\nNow I calculate the second and third guesses. I wanted to penalize duplicate letters, so I used the unique letter scoring function and removed the letters from the first guess. I couldn’t figure out how to do that automatically, so I hardcoded to remove the letters “a”, “r”, “o”, “s”, and “e” from the words before I sent them to be scored. This is precisely the kind of situation where you can get bogged down doing things “properly” and end up stuck. I quickly attempted to figure it out and then did it incorrectly. You can also see that I have a bunch of stuff commented out that didn’t work and a bunch of print statements for debugging. This is not pretty code.\nThen I loop through the list again and repeat for the last guess. Again, hardcoded in the letters to remove from the first and second guesses.\n\n#now we need a function that sees if a word has the letters of the word_1\n#and removes them and then calculates the word score\n#top word is arose\n# Word 1= arose -----\nind3 <- 1\nfor (ind3 in 1:num_words) {\n # print(top_words$word_name[ind3])\n  test <- small_list[[ind3,1]]\n  lvec <- gsub(\"[a r o s e]\", \"\", test)  #this actually works.

    "text": "4. Critique the code\nThis step is the critical step to accelerate your learning. You need to review your code and list everything you know is not done properly and everything confusing you. This should be done at the end of every session or at the start of the next. Be honest with yourself. If you don’t understand something, put it on your list, even if your code works. The point of this exercise is to increase your coding proficiency.\nThis is my list from that code we just reviewed. I created this the next day before I started work. Note my versioning by file name.\n\nSave current code as frequency_072222 and work on a new copy. This was functional code last night, so I want to keep it.\nImport is wrong because it takes the first word as a header.\nI need more concise variable names. Also, I create a bunch of temp variables that aren’t needed.\nI manually subtract out (hard-coded) words picked in previous cycles. I need that done on the fly.\nOnce 4 is done, I’d like to write a function to generate however many guesses you ask for.\nI’d like to look at the histogram of the scores as you cycle through the guesses.\nI’m very unclear on when I need lists, dataframes, tibbles, etc., for the different functions.\nGive credit to the website where I took the string split code from.\nSome functions from the other code are out of date, so I should update them. [I got warnings in R Studio about this, which I didn’t understand.]\nUpdate scoring_word to have flexible word length.\n\nAgain, there is a lot more wrong with this code, but this is the list of things I could identify with the knowledge I had at the time.\nThe next day, I created a chart of all my variables, their sizes, and their types. I also proposed new, clearer names for them, though this wasn’t implemented until a few days later. I mostly played around with how long it took to calculate the initial score and unique score using separate or combined loops. I used sys.time() to benchmark, which didn’t seem terribly consistent in its output. However, there didn’t seem to be a huge difference between the methods, so I returned it to two loops for clarity. At the end of this day, I had four items on my task list after critiquing and reviewing. The last one was, “I need to figure out git_hub or come up with a better way of versioning than the date.”\nProving that point, I put the wrong date in all the file names the next time I worked on the code. In that session, I devoted most of the time to figuring out item 4 on my task list. I wrote a function called remove_letters, which could be used instead of hard coding. I also played around with reshaping the data using pivot_longer from tidyr. I created a histogram of word scores as letters are removed from consideration, which required the reshaped data. Reshaping data can be tricky, so this was a good opportunity to work through that process. (Again, versioning by name, this was called “frequency_072422_tidyr”, in case I really messed up.)"

    "text": "This is the current version of the word game guesser. I discussed how I used this project to hone my coding skills in the companion blog post to this one.\nI’m not going to walk through this in much detail, but I’m going to point out some of the major lessons I learned as I revised the code. Again, both the initial version and this version are on GitHub in all their messiness.\nI learned how to put functions in a separate file and call them from my many script. This can make long code much easier to read. Here, I’ve included the helper functions in-line and commented out the source(\"code/helper-functions.R\") in the main code. I’ve also set up switchable troubleshooting help with verbose and debug_detail parameters in my functions. Setting them to TRUE provide more info as the functions are executed.\n\n#|label: helper-functions\nConstruct_Freq_Table <- function(word_list) {\n\n#scoring code uses the counting code from\n\n#https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/12/rrrrs-in-r-letter-frequency-in-r-package-names/  \n# making the frequency table ----\n\nletters <- unlist(strsplit(word_list[,1], split = \"\"))\nchar_frequencies <- as.data.frame(table(letters))\n\n#normalized\ncommon <- max(char_frequencies[,2])\ny = (char_frequencies[,2]/common)\nchar_frequencies$normalized <- y\nreturn(char_frequencies)\n}\n\nScoring_Word <- function(word, freqs = char_frequencies,\n                         verbose = FALSE, debug_detail = FALSE){\n  letter_vec <-  unlist(strsplit(word, split = \"\"))\n    if (verbose == TRUE)\n    {message(\"I'm in Scoring_words message and scoring: \", word)}\n  \n  value <- 0\n  for (i in 1:length(letter_vec)) {\n    position <- letter_vec[i]== freqs$letters\n    value[i] <- freqs$normalized[position]\n    if (debug_detail == TRUE)\n    {\n      print(\"I am in the scoring loop calculating value: \")\n      print(i)\n      print(sum(value))\n      \n    }\n    \n    if (i == length(letter_vec)) {\n      \n      return(total <- sum(value))\n    }\n    \n  }\n  }\n  \n\nScoring_Word_Unique <- function(word, freqs = char_frequencies, \n                                verbose = FALSE, debug_detail = FALSE){\n  # This does only score on unique letters\n  letter_vec <-  unlist(strsplit(word, split = \"\"))\n  unique_letter_vec <- unique(letter_vec)\n  #unique_letter_vec <- letter_vec\n  if (verbose == TRUE)\n  {message(\"I'm in Scoring_words_Unique and scoring: \", word)}\n  \n  value <- 0\n  if (length(unique_letter_vec) == 0) {\n    return(value)\n  } else{\n    for (i in 1:length(unique_letter_vec)) {\n           position <- unique_letter_vec[i] == freqs$letters\n          value[i] <- freqs$normalized[position]\n      if (debug_detail == TRUE)\n      {\n        print(\"I am in the unique scoring loop calculating value: \")\n        print(i)\n        print(sum(value))\n      }\n      \n      if (i == length(unique_letter_vec)) {\n        \n        return(total <- sum(value))\n      }\n      \n    }\n  }\n}\n\nRemoving_Letters <- function(word, chosen_word, \n                              verbose = FALSE, debug_detail = FALSE) {\n  lvec <- gsub(paste0(\"[\", chosen_word, \"]\"), \"\", word)  \n  return(lvec)}\n\nI finally did figure out how to make variables the types I wanted. I also replaced several loops with map functions from purrr. I also made a reshaped version of my dataframe using pivot_longer from tidyr. Reshaping data is a really useful skill, but might be a bit confusing at first. So I certainly wanted to make sure I could do it correctly.

    "title": "30 Day Chart Challenge -Arlington Parks",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When I looked at Twitter this morning, my feed was filled with amazing charts. Apparently, April is month for the #30DayChartChallenge. More info can be found at the challenge’s Github page. Each day, the challenge specifies a type of chart, but not a dataset. Today’s challenge is to create a waffle chart. I’d never heard of a waffle chart, but luckily, R has a package for that!\nKeeping it simple and just using tidyverse and waffle packages today. (Spoiler, I had incredible difficulties with this package.)\n\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nA waffle chart is similar to a pie chart, but since it is constructed from squares, instead of wedges, it is a bit easier to correctly judge the relative areas.\nI discovered that Arlington County has a website with a bunch of open source data, so I poked around there to find a dataset for today’s challenge. I decided to use the dataset on parks and acreage. In addition to having local and federally owned parks, Arlington is park of a consortium of Northern Virginia jurisdictions that also operate regional parks.\n\nparks <- read_csv(\"parks.csv\")\n\nRows: 10 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (6): Profile Year, County Owned Parkland (Acreage), NOVA Parks (Acreage)...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThe dataset contains 3 years worth of data (2019-2021) and the total number of acres owned by the county, NOVA parks, and the National Park Service. It also includes the number of parks own by NOVA parks and the county, but not the number of NPS parks. I did try to find the number of NPS parks and the answer isn’t easily obtainable. The NPS owns one park in Arlington (Arlington House), but there are a couple of multi-state trails that might go through the county, but I wasn’t interested in pulling up maps to check.\nThe dataset comes as an excel sheet and the column names aren’t nice. I’ve been working with so many datasets designed for R or SQL that it was a shock to see long column names with spaces and punctuation. I had to look up how to handle that! The answer is backticks, as below.\n\nparks_2021 <- parks %>%\n  filter(`Profile Year` == 2021)\n\nI’m going to rename the columns and in this filtered dataset. There isn’t much year to year change in this dataset (there is one extra park in 2020), so I’m not going to do anything with the entire dataset. If I were, I’d rename the parent dataset.\n\nparks_2021 <- parks_2021 %>%\n  transmute(year = `Profile Year`,\n         county_acres = `County Owned Parkland (Acreage)`,\n         NOVA_acres = `NOVA Parks (Acreage)`,\n         NPS_acres = `National Parks Service (Acreage)`) \n\nparks_2021 <- parks_2021 %>%\n  select(-year)\n\nNow let’s get waffling!\nAllegedly, you can both pass waffle dataframes or use the provided geom_waffle, but neither was successful for me. With respect to the geom_waffle, I found a suggestion to install waffle from the github repo and restart R Studio, but that didn’t work for me. Others stated that re-installing R Studio fixed the problem, but my commitment to waffle charts is not that great.\nAs to passing it dataframes, waffle constantly complained about 'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double' even when using code from other folk’s tutorial. Passing waffle a simple vector did work.\n\n# Vector\nx <- c(30, 25, 20, 5)\n\n# Waffle chart\nwaffle(x, rows = 8)\n\n\n\n\nSo, I converted my dataframe to a vector. First, I reshaped it to long rather than wide. (Neither the long nor the wide df waffled.)\n\nparks_2021_long <- pivot_longer(parks_2021, cols = 1:3, names_to = \"owner\", values_to = \"acreage\")\n\nThen I converted it to a vector. This should be a named vector of numbers.\n\nparks_2021_vec = deframe(parks_2021_long)\nclass(parks_2021_vec)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nprint(parks_2021_vec)\n\ncounty_acres   NOVA_acres    NPS_acres \n         924          136          417 \n\nstr(parks_2021_vec)\n\n Named num [1:3] 924 136 417\n - attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:3] \"county_acres\" \"NOVA_acres\" \"NPS_acres\"\n\n\nLet’s waffle it. When I first waffled it, I got 4 categories instead of 3. I found an example that said you needed to explicitly pass it 3 colors or else it would fill in the blank space with a 4th color. Then you get the correct labels, but no chart!\n\n#This waffles, it seems like nonsense to me\n\nwaffle(parks_2021_vec, colors = c(\"#FFC0CB\", \"#FFC0AB\", \"green\"))\n\n\n\n\nSo now we reached the sad state of affairs where I type in the values to make this work. And that also does not work.\n\nx <- c(county = 924, nova = 136, nps = 417)\n\n# Waffle chart\nwaffle(x , rows = 10)\n\n\n\n\nSmall numbers work\n\ny <- c(county = 9.24, nova = 1.36, nps = 4.17)\n\n# Waffle chart\nwaffle(y ,  rows = 10)\n\n\n\n\nIf I convert everything to percentages…\n\ntotal = 924 + 136 + 417\ny <- c(county = (924/total)*100, nova = (136/total)*100, nps = (417/total)*100)\n\n# Waffle chart\nwaffle(y ,  rows = 10)\n\n\n\n\nI don’t find any documentation about the size of the numbers. It is not a requirement that the totals must add up to 100 (100%); small numbers adding up to anything works. Waffle charts are not only for proportional data, but can also be used to track progress. There is nothing in the documentation on CRAN that gives a clue about this, nor did I see anything in the tutorials I looked at.\nI’m going to pretty up the chart and call it a day. I thought this would take me about 20 minutes to make a nice chart and instead I’ve spent several hours and I don’t even understand what went wrong. Also, the named vector does work when I adjust the size of the numbers to “smaller” values. I picked nice forest colors since we are talking about parks.\n\nparks_2021_percent = (parks_2021_vec / total) * 100\n\n\nwaffle(parks_2021_percent, colors = c(\"darkgreen\", \"darkseagreen\", \"darkolivegreen\"), title = \"Who owns the parks in Arlington, Virginia?\")\n\n\n\n\nI don’t really understand the waffle package. I don’t find the graphic particularly understandable. I’d like there to be some sort of indication about what each square represents. And I find it very annoying that there are not 100 squares. I know this is a rounding issue, but given that the dataset, by the nature of how it was created, should equal 100%, the chart is just confusing.

There are other types of box turtles though not all of them are in Emydidae. Asian box turtle species were reassigned to the family Geoemydidae.\nThe common name box turtle, arises from the fact that these species have a hinge on the bottom shell, and can close up/ box up completely.

I’m assuming the recommendations will be enacted/adopted eventually, so I am using them as the correct current status.\nWe have 7 levels in recommendations. We need to consolidate them. I’m going to combine “Delist: The listed entity does not meet the statutory definition of a species” and “Delist: The species does not meet the definition of an endangered species or a threatened species” into a level called delisted. The delisting because the species is extinct will be made into a level called extinct later.\n\nendangered_df_sub <- endangered_df_sub %>%\n  mutate(condensed = fct_collapse(rec, delisted = c(\"Delist: The listed entity does not meet the statutory definition of a species\",\n    \"Delist: The species does not meet the definition of an endangered species or a threatened species\")\n  ))\n\nI’m going to count both “Downlist to threatened” and “uplist to Endangered” as endangered.

I’m using a case_when and listing every combination. I could get this done if fewer lines if I used or statements (E or T is endangered), but I left it more granular in case I wanted to come back and change the levels. Maybe later I do care about the different between threatened and endangered and want to break them out separately.\n\nendangered_df_sub <- endangered_df_sub %>%\n  mutate(condensed = case_when(\n    condensed == \"No change in Status\" & status == \"E\" ~ \"endangered\",\n    condensed == \"No change in Status\" & status == \"T\" ~ \"endangered\",\n    condensed == \"No change in Status\" & status == \"RT\" ~ \"delisted\",\n    condensed == \"No change in Status\" & status == \"D3A\" ~ \"extinct\",\n    condensed == \"No change in Status\" & status == \"DM\" ~ \"delisted\",\n    condensed == \"No change in Status\" & status == \"DP\" ~ \"delisted\",\n    condensed == \"No change in Status\" & status == \"DR\" ~ \"delisted\",\n    condensed == \"No change in Status\" & status == \"DNS\" ~ \"delisted\",\n    condensed != \"No change in Status\" ~ condensed)\n    )\n\nNow I’m going to group my extincts.\n\nendangered_df_sub <- endangered_df_sub %>%\n  mutate(condensed = \n           fct_collapse(condensed, extinct = \n                          c(\"Delist: The species is extinct\", \"extinct\")))\n\nI’m not sure what : Revision of listed entity means.

It does let you use a dataframe, but it also doesn’t handle large numbers well.

    "section": "",
    "text": "As I’ve started working on more complicated machine learning projects, I’ve leaned into the tidymodels approach. Tidymodels is a highly modular approach, and I felt it reduced the number of errors, especially when evaluating many machine models and different preprocessing steps. (This is, in fact, a stated goal of the tidymodels ecosystem.)\nThis tutorial is more about understanding the process of modeling in tidymodels and learning about the various objects created at different steps rather than optimizing a machine learning model.\nThroughout this tutorial, I will use the word “procedure” to describe a set of steps to go from data to final predictions. I’m doing this because tidymodels uses the word workflow for specific types of objects and functions. It would be too confusing to use workflow to also describe the process/procedure.\nBut the tidymodels ecosystem can also be very confusing. There are several component packages in tidymodels. While it is easy to explain what a recipe object (from the recipe package) does, it became increasingly difficult for me to name and describe the objects I was creating as I started building more sophisticated machine-learning procedures. And I found it even more confusing that simple and complex procedures, while going through the same basic steps (preprocess, train, evaluate, predict), created objects with different structures and data within them. I found it confusing that fit, last_fit, fit_resamples, etc., did not all produce objects that contained the same information and could be acted on by the same functions. In my first attempt at using last_fit(), I ended up scrapping the entire ML section and redoing it with fit()/predict() because I couldn’t figure out how to get the predictions out of the object created by last_fit().\nAdding to my woes was the fact that attempting to view/print/ examine these objects, especially in notebook environments, often caused the entire project to time out. RStudio generally handles these objects more gracefully, but I’ve also crashed it hard. It also isn’t consistent whether an object will lock-up RStudio or not. Once RStudio has locked up, restarting the program leads to an increasing number of freezes/locking up, until the computer is restarted.\nI’ve also manually numbered my code blocks and used that for referencing. I believe it is possible to hyperlink code chunks in Quarto, but I plan to replicate this project in an online notebook environment where that isn’t possible. The manual numbering will make it easier to cross-reference the two. I found online notebooks really did not like displaying many tidymodels objects. That’s also why there are timers around many of the display calls.\nSo here I’m going to go through three different procedures for modeling. I will compare and contrast the objects created as we move through the different procedures."

Broom is part of the core tidymodels installation, so it does not need to be installed separately. To get the model coefficients and p-values in tibble form, use tidy(). For high-level statistics about the model, use glance(). Just remember that the information you extract from the output of fit() relates to the model as applied to the training data. For information about the model performance as applied to the test data, you need to use the output of predict(). Since this output is only a vector of predictions, you need to bind it to the test dataframe and then perform analysis on the new object.\nSo it is pretty straightforward to get our model coefficients:\n\n# Code block 13: Summarize wflow_fit with tidy\nwflow_fit %>% tidy() #summarizes information about model components\n\n# A tibble: 21 × 5\n   term                   estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n   <chr>                     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 (Intercept)             7.07       0.0703   101.    0        \n 2 lat_trans              -0.102      0.0305    -3.36  7.94e-  4\n 3 long_trans             -0.0141     0.0306    -0.462 6.44e-  1\n 4 distance_miles          0.0653     0.0318     2.05  4.02e-  2\n 5 age                    -0.268      0.0289    -9.27  1.87e- 20\n 6 hour                   -0.828      0.0397   -20.9   1.27e- 96\n 7 weekday                -0.127      0.0288    -4.41  1.03e-  5\n 8 amt_log                -1.87       0.0510   -36.7   2.76e-294\n 9 category_food_dining   -0.00929    0.0599    -0.155 8.77e-  1\n10 category_gas_transport -0.628      0.0593   -10.6   3.62e- 26\n# ℹ 11 more rows\n\n\nOr to get details of the model performance:\n\n# Code block 14: model info from wflow_fit with glance\nwflow_fit %>% glance() #reports information about the entire model\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 8\n  null.deviance df.null logLik    AIC    BIC deviance df.residual   nobs\n          <dbl>   <int>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>    <dbl>       <int>  <int>\n1        16568.  254704 -5956. 11953. 12173.   11911.      254684 254705"

    "text": "last_fit()\nSo, from the tidymodels webpage, last_fit() is described as “last_fit() emulates the process where, after determining the best model, the final fit on the entire training set is needed and is then evaluated on the test set.” (Actually this is from the tune subpage, which is important, though I didn’t realize it.)\nI pass the workflow to last_fit() along with the data split object (with the info about testing and training) and the metrics set. In theory, the result should be the same as from fit()/predict() above.\n\n# Code block 15: Using lastfit() in hard classifier mode\nlast_fit_results <- last_fit(wflow_fit, data_split, metrics = fraud_metrics_hard)\n\nSo, I look at the results just as I did with predict in Code Block 11. And RStudio sometimes locks up. Other times, it produces a high-level overview as expected.\n\n# Code block 16: creating a workflow set\nstart_time_display <- Sys.time()\nhead(last_fit_results) \n\n# Resampling results\n# Manual resampling \n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  splits                 id            .metrics .notes   .predictions .workflow \n  <list>                 <chr>         <list>   <list>   <list>       <list>    \n1 <split [254705/84902]> train/test s… <tibble> <tibble> <tibble>     <workflow>\n\nend_time_display <- Sys.time()\nprint(paste(\"last_fit_results: \", end_time_display - start_time_display))\n\n[1] \"last_fit_results:  0.0788729190826416\"\n\n\nSo how to get the predictions out? According to the manual page for last_fit(), the output is “A single row tibble that emulates the structure of fit_resamples(). However, a list column called .workflow is also attached with the fitted model (and recipe, if any) that used the training set.” I also see that last_fit() is actually from the tune package and not from parsnip as I expected. Nothing I’m doing here involves tuning hyperparameters at all. I expected that is was a parsnip object both thematically and because you interact with last_fit() using extract_fit_parsnip(), see Code Block 23.\nLooking fit_resamples() isn’t very helpful for answering this question. (Oh, but it is. It just took me another few paragraphs of writing to realize it.)\nI did find a Stackoverflow discussion that provided the answer in their code: last_fit1_pred <- last_fit1[[5]][[1]]\nThat’s not very straightforward!\nPull out the predictions from last_fit_pred.\n\n# Code block 17: extracting predictions from last_fit\nlast_fit_pred <- last_fit_results[[5]][[1]]\n\nLook at the head() of this object.\n\n# Code block 18: Examine the outcome of lastfit by head\nhead(last_fit_pred)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  .pred_class  .row is_fraud .config             \n  <fct>       <int> <fct>    <chr>               \n1 0               1 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n2 0               2 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n3 0               8 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n4 0              12 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n5 0              13 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n6 0              14 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n\n\nLook at the head() of the object from predict().\n\n# Code block 19: Examine the outcome of predict by head\nhead(wflow_predict)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 1\n  .pred_class\n  <fct>      \n1 0          \n2 0          \n3 0          \n4 0          \n5 0          \n6 0          \n\n\nUse identical() to compare the two hard predictions and verify they are the same.\n\n# Code block 20: showing that predict and the predictions in last_fit are the same\nidentical(last_fit_pred$.pred_class, wflow_predict$.pred_class)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nNow, let the realization of what all the stuff about the tune package means hit you. We now know the full secrets of last_fit(). It turns out that any of the helper functions for tuning functions from the tune package work on last_fit() because it is a tune function. I don’t find the documentation for either the helper functions or last_fit() make that connection clear. I think that is what the reference to fit_resamples() on the last_fit() page is getting at.\nTidy Modeling with R also contains an example of using collect_predictions with last_fit(), but most examples are with tuning functions, so obviously from the tune family. One of the tutorials on the main tidymodels webpage does as well. But in general, extracting predictions from the test data is not demonstrated, just collecting metrics and analyzing model performance. So it is hard to google your way to the answer. This is the kind of situation I’ve struggled with throughout learning tidymodels and part of what motivated me to write this tutorial.\nSo now I get the predictions the easy way.\n\n# Code block 21: Examine the outcome of lastfit by head\nhead(last_fit_pred)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  .pred_class  .row is_fraud .config             \n  <fct>       <int> <fct>    <chr>               \n1 0               1 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n2 0               2 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n3 0               8 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n4 0              12 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n5 0              13 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n6 0              14 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n\nlast_fit_results %>% collect_predictions()\n\n# A tibble: 84,902 × 5\n   id               .pred_class  .row is_fraud .config             \n   <chr>            <fct>       <int> <fct>    <chr>               \n 1 train/test split 0               1 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n 2 train/test split 0               2 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n 3 train/test split 0               8 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n 4 train/test split 0              12 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n 5 train/test split 0              13 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n 6 train/test split 0              14 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n 7 train/test split 0              16 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n 8 train/test split 0              17 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n 9 train/test split 0              19 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n10 train/test split 0              25 0        Preprocessor1_Model1\n# ℹ 84,892 more rows\n\n\nAnd can evaluate the model performance.\n\n# Code block 22: collecting metrics from lastfit collect_metrics()\nlast_fit_results %>% collect_metrics()\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  .metric  .estimator .estimate .config             \n  <chr>    <chr>          <dbl> <chr>               \n1 accuracy binary         0.995 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\n\nAnd extract the fit. This extract_fit_parsnip() result is an identical parsnip object as the workflow_fit object we got from fit() and can be handled the same way (i.e. via broom). You can refer back to Code Block 13 to see the results are the same. This is perhaps the key takeaway; these larger, more complex objects contain the simpler objects (workflows, parsnip objects) and they should be extracted and handled normally. Understanding this will make understanding how to handle a workflow_set() much easier.\n\n# Code block 23: extract model coefficients from last_fit() \nlast_fit_results %>% extract_fit_parsnip() %>% tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 21 × 5\n   term                   estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n   <chr>                     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 (Intercept)             7.07       0.0703   101.    0        \n 2 lat_trans              -0.102      0.0305    -3.36  7.94e-  4\n 3 long_trans             -0.0141     0.0306    -0.462 6.44e-  1\n 4 distance_miles          0.0653     0.0318     2.05  4.02e-  2\n 5 age                    -0.268      0.0289    -9.27  1.87e- 20\n 6 hour                   -0.828      0.0397   -20.9   1.27e- 96\n 7 weekday                -0.127      0.0288    -4.41  1.03e-  5\n 8 amt_log                -1.87       0.0510   -36.7   2.76e-294\n 9 category_food_dining   -0.00929    0.0599    -0.155 8.77e-  1\n10 category_gas_transport -0.628      0.0593   -10.6   3.62e- 26\n# ℹ 11 more rows"

Realizing how/when to extract or reduce the more complex objects to the simpler objects is key to using tidymodels effectively.\n\n# Code Block 30: last_fit for a workflow with hyperparameter\nvalidation_results <- tune_results %>%\n  extract_workflow(\"down_glmnet\") %>%\n  finalize_workflow(best_hyperparam) %>%\n  last_fit(split =  data_split, metrics = fraud_metrics)\n\nNow we can handle this object exactly as before.\n\n# Code Block 31: Metric for best model with the test data\nhead(collect_predictions(validation_results))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  id               .pred_1 .pred_0  .row .pred_class is_fraud .config           \n  <chr>              <dbl>   <dbl> <int> <fct>       <fct>    <chr>             \n1 train/test split  0.551    0.449     1 1           0        Preprocessor1_Mod…\n2 train/test split  0.217    0.783     2 0           0        Preprocessor1_Mod…\n3 train/test split  0.0342   0.966     8 0           0        Preprocessor1_Mod…\n4 train/test split  0.474    0.526    12 0           0        Preprocessor1_Mod…\n5 train/test split  0.0263   0.974    13 0           0        Preprocessor1_Mod…\n6 train/test split  0.316    0.684    14 0           0        Preprocessor1_Mod…\n\nvalidation_results %>% \n  collect_predictions() %>% \n  roc_curve(is_fraud, .pred_1) %>% \n  autoplot() + \n  ggtitle(\"ROC Curve\")\n\n\n\n\nSo that’s it. I hope this clarifies some of the different procedures you can use to fit models in the tidymodels framework."

I also wanted to fully use the tidymodels framework, particularly more advanced functionalities like workflowsets. There are some great tutorials on tidymodels, in particular Olivier Gimenez’s tutorial on Kaggle’s Titanic competition. This tutorial steps through each model individually, while I wanted to use the more streamlined approach offered by workflowsets. I also found myself confused as I started doing more advanced procedures in tidymodels, despite having read the book Tidy Modeling with R multiple times and working through several tutorials on Julia Silge’s excellent blog. I ended up writing my own tutorial on tidymodels objects that goes through the differences in the various ways to perform fitting and the various objects produced.\nIn addition to providing a template for the machine learning portion, I wanted to create nice figures and tables that could also be re-used.\nI will also have a different version of this code on Datacamp. I’ve numbered the code chunks manually to aid in comparison between the two versions. I start numbering at 2, because Code Block 1 will be installing libraries at the Datacamp workspace. There are some important differences between the RStudio environment and online notebooks/workspaces.\nPlease feel free to copy and use any of my code in your work.

    "text": "5.1. Looking at the strings\nStrings are usually not a useful format for classification problems. The strings should be converted to factors, dropped, or otherwise transformed.\n5.1.1. Strings to Factors (Code Block 6 - 8)\n\ncategory, Category of Merchant\njob, Job of Credit Card Holder\n\n5.1.2. Strings as Strings (Code Block 9)\n\nmerchant, Merchant Name\ntrans_num, Transaction Number\n\nI’m not going to retain these, as they are either unlikely to have predictive power (trans_num) or are highly correlated with other predictors (merchant with merch_lat/merch_long.)\n5.2. Strings to Geospatial Data (Code Block 13)\nWe have plenty of geospatial data as lat/long pairs, so I want to convert city/state to lat/long so I can compare to the other geospatial variables. This will also make it easier to compute new variables like the distance the transaction is from the home location. I will transform and explore this when I handle the other geospatial data.\n\ncity, City of Credit Card Holder\nstate, State of Credit Card Holder\n\nThings to consider as we walk through the data:\n\nDo we have typos that lead to duplicate entries : VA/ Va. / Virginia?\nDo we have excessive # of categories? Do we want to combine some?\nShould they be ordered?\n\n\n5.1.1. Exploring the factors: how is the compactness of categories?\nThe predictors category and job are transformed into factors.\n\n# Code Block 6: Converting Strings to Factors\nfraud$category <- factor(fraud$category)\nfraud$job <- factor(fraud$job)\n\nFrom the skim output, I see that category has 14 unique values, and job has 163 unique values. The dataset is quite large, with 339,607 records, so these variables don’t have an excessive number of levels at first glance. However, it is worth seeing if I can compact the levels to a smaller number.\n\nWhy do we care about the number of categories and whether they are “excessive”?\nConsider the extreme case where a dataset had categories that only contained one record each. There is simply insufficient data to make correct predictions using category as a predictor on new data with that category label. Additionally, if your modeling uses dummy variables, having an extremely large number of categories will lead to the production of a huge number of predictors, which can slow down the fitting. This is fine if all the predictors are useful, but if they aren’t useful (as in the case of having only one record for a category), trimming them will improve the speed and quality of the data fitting.\nIf I had subject matter expertise, I could manually combine categories. For example, in this dataset, the three largest categories in job are surveying-related and perhaps could be combined. If you don’t have subject matter expertise, or if performing this task would be too labor intensive, then you can use cutoffs based on the amount of data in a category. If the majority of the data exists in only a few categories, then it might be reasonable to keep those categories and lump everything else in an “other” category or perhaps even drop the data points in smaller categories. As a side note, the forcats package has a variety of tools to handle consolidating and dropping levels based on different cutoffs if this is the approach you decide to take.\nOne way to evaluate the compactness of a factor is to group the data by category and look at a table of counts. I like the gt package for making attractive tables in R. (Uncomment the line in Code Block 7 #gt:::as.tags.gt_tbl(table_3a) to see the table.) The tabular data also shows that there aren’t typos leading to duplicate categories.\nAnother way to evaluate the compactness is to make a cumulative plot. This looks at the proportion of data that is described as you add categories. I’m using the cowplot package to make multipanel figures. I want to look at both factors at once; this is fine for exploratory data analysis, but I wouldn’t recommend it for a report or presentation, since there is no connection between the two variables.\n\n# Code Block 7: Exploring the Compactness of the Categories\n\n# Exploring the jobs factor\n# bin and count the data and return sorted\ntable_3a_data <- fraud %>% count(job, sort = TRUE) \n\n# creating a table to go with this, but not displaying it\ntable_3a <- table_3a_data %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  tab_header(title = \"Jobs of Card Holders\") %>%\n  cols_label(job = \"Jobs\", n = \"Count\") %>%\n  opt_stylize(style = 1,\n              color = \"green\",\n              add_row_striping = TRUE)\n#gt:::as.tags.gt_tbl(table_3a)  #displays the table \n\nfig_1a <- ggplot(table_3a_data, aes(\n  x = 1:nlevels(fraud$job),\n  y = (cumsum(n) * 100 / nrow(fraud))\n)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"darkcyan\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 80) +  #marker for 80% of the data\n  xlab(\"jobs index\") +\n  ylab(\"% of Total\") +\n  ylim(0, 100) # +\n  #ggtitle(\"Jobs of Card Holder\")  #use if standalone graph\n                       \n\n# same as above, but just for the category variable\ntable_3b_data <- fraud %>% count(category, sort = TRUE)\ntable_3b <- table_3b_data %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  tab_header(title = \"Transaction Category in Credit Card Fraud\") %>%\n  cols_label(category = \"Category\", n = \"Count\") %>%\n  opt_stylize(style = 1,\n              color = \"blue\",\n              add_row_striping = TRUE) #%>%\n#gt:::as.tags.gt_tbl(table_3b)\n\nfig_1b <- ggplot(table_3b_data, aes(\n  x = 1:nlevels(fraud$category),\n  y = (cumsum(n) * 100 / nrow(fraud))\n)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"darkcyan\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 80) +\n  xlab(\"category index\") +\n  ylab(\"% of Total\") +\n  ylim(0, 100) #+\n#ggtitle(\"Jobs of Card Holder\") #use if standalone graph\n\n\n#this makes the panel grid and labels it\nplot_fig_1 <-\n  plot_grid(fig_1a,\n            fig_1b,\n            labels = c('A', 'B'),\n            label_size = 14)\n\n#This creates the figure title\ntitle_1 <- ggdraw() +\n  draw_label(\n    \"Figure 1: Exploring Categorical Variables\",\n    fontface = 'bold',\n    x = 0,\n    hjust = 0,\n    size = 14\n  ) +\n  theme(# add margin on the left of the drawing canvas,\n    # so title is aligned with left edge of first plot\n    plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 7))\n\n#this combines the panel grid, title, and displays both\nplot_grid(title_1,\n          plot_fig_1,\n          ncol = 1,\n          # rel_heights values control vertical title margins\n          rel_heights = c(0.1, 1))\n\n\n\n\nIf you look at Figure 1A, roughly 75-80 categories have to be included to capture 80% of the data. For Figure 1B, roughly ten categories have to be included. Ideally, you’d like a very steep curve initially (where a “small number” of categories cover the “majority” of the data) and then a long, shallow tail approaching 100% that corresponds to the data to be binned in “other” or dropped. There aren’t hard and fast rules on making these decisions. I decided to use 80% as my threshold. Both of these curves look relatively shallow to me, so I decided not to do any binning, grouping, or dropping of levels.\nI decided to look at all the categories of transactions just to see which ones were the most common.\n\n# Code Block 8: Exploring the Category factor\nggplot(fraud, aes(fct_infreq(category))) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"darkcyan\", fill = \"darkcyan\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Figure 2: Types of Transactions\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  xlab(\"Merchant Type\")\n\n\n\n\nGas/transport was the most common category, and grocery was the second most common, both of which make sense. The least common category was travel. Nothing seemed unusual in the ranking.\n\n\n\n5.1.2. Looking at our character strings\nMerchant name (merchant) and transaction number(trans_num) are both strings. Transaction number should not influence fraud rate as it is a number assigned to the transaction when processed. I will drop it from our dataset. Merchant name could be correlated with fraud, for example, if a company’s employee was involved. However, this data is also represented by the location and category. If a location/category is found to have higher levels of fraud, then a more detailed examination of those transactions can be performed, including the merchant name. Here, I also remove it from the dataset.\n\n# Code Block 9: Removing Character/ String Variables\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  select(-merchant,-trans_num)"

Looking at the geographic data\nThis data is coded as numeric (latitude and longitude) or character (city/state), but we can recognize it as geographic data and treat it appropriately.\nFirst, there are two sets of geographic data related to the merchant. The location of the merchant and where the transaction occurred. I create scatter plots of latitude and longitude separately, because I want to check the correlation between the two sources of data (merchant and transaction). I create a shared legend following the article here.\n\n# Code Block 10: Comparing Merchant and Transaction Locations\n\n# calculate correlations\ncor_lat <- round(cor(fraud$lat, fraud$merch_lat), 3)\ncor_long <- round(cor(fraud$long, fraud$merch_long), 3)\n\n# make figure\nfig_3a <-\n  ggplot(fraud, aes(lat, merch_lat, fill = factor(is_fraud))) +\n  geom_point(\n    alpha = 1,\n    shape = 21,\n    colour = \"black\",\n    size = 5\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Latitude\") +\n  ylab(\"Merchant Latitude\") +\n  xlab(\"Transaction Latitude\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    discrete = TRUE,\n    labels = c('Not Fraud', 'Fraud'),\n    name = \"\"\n  ) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) \n\nfig_3b <-\n  ggplot(fraud, aes(long, merch_long, fill = factor(is_fraud))) +\n  geom_point(\n    alpha = 1,\n    shape = 21,\n    colour = \"black\",\n    size = 5\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Longitude\") +\n  ylab(\"Merchant Longitude\") +\n  xlab(\"Transaction Longitude\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    discrete = TRUE,\n    labels = c('Not Fraud', 'Fraud'),\n    name = \"\"\n  ) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) \n\n# create the plot with the two figs on a grid, no legend\nprow_fig_3 <- plot_grid(\n  fig_3a + theme(legend.position = \"none\"),\n  fig_3b + theme(legend.position = \"none\"),\n  align = 'vh',\n  labels = c(\"A\", \"B\"),\n  label_size = 12,\n  hjust = -1,\n  nrow = 1\n)\n\n# extract the legend from one of the figures\nlegend <- get_legend(\n  fig_3a + \n    guides(color = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n)\n\n# add the legend to the row of figures, prow_fig_3\nplot_fig_3 <- plot_grid(prow_fig_3, legend, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(1, .1))\n\n# title\ntitle_3 <- ggdraw() +\n  draw_label(\n    \"Figure 3.

So I remove merch_lat and merch_long from the dataset.\n\n# Code Block 11: Removing merch_lat and merch_long\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  select(-merch_lat,-merch_long) %>%\n  rename(lat_trans = lat, long_trans = long)\n\nNext, I will look and see if some locations are more prone to fraud.\n\n# Code Block 12: Looking at Fraud by Location\nggplot(fraud, aes(long_trans, lat_trans, fill = factor(is_fraud))) +\n  geom_point(\n    alpha = 1,\n    shape = 21,\n    colour = \"black\",\n    size = 5,\n    position = \"jitter\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    discrete = TRUE,\n    labels = c('Not Fraud', 'Fraud'),\n    name = \"\"\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Figure 4: Where does fraud occur? \") +\n  ylab(\"Latitude\") +\n  xlab(\"Longitude\") \n\n\n\n\nIt looks like there are some locations which only have fraudulent transactions.\nNext, I’m going to convert city/state into latitude and longitude using the tidygeocoder package. Also included code to save this output and then re-import it. You likely do not want to be pulling the data from the internet every time you run the code, so this gives you the option to work from a local copy. For many services, it is against terms of service to repeatedly make the same calls rather than working from a local version. I did find that I could originally pull all data from ‘osm’, but while double checking this code, I found that the service is now imposing some rate limit and denies some requests, leading to some NA entries. So do check your results.\n\n# Code Block 13: Converting city/state data lat/long\n\n# need to pass an address to geo to convert to lat/long\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  mutate(address = str_c(city, state, sep = \" , \"))\n\n# generate a list of distinct addresses to look up\n# the dataset is large, so it is better to only look up unique address rather that the address\n# for every record\naddress_list <- fraud %>%\n  distinct(address)\n\n# this has one more than number in the cities, so there must be a city with the same name in more than one state.\n\n#I don't want to run this api call everytime I open the notebook, so I downloaded the data and will reimport it and load it\n# Below is the code to run the call.  Uncomment it.\n# gets coordinates for city,states\n#home_coords <-\n#  geo(address_list$address,\n#      method = \"osm\",\n#      full_results = FALSE)\n#write.csv(\"home_coords.csv\", home_coords)\n#home_coords <- home_coords %>%\n#  rename(lat_home = lat, long_home = long)\n\n# I downloaded it using the gui interface provided by datacamp when you view the object.

I think distance might be a feature that is related to fraud. I followed the tutorial here for calculating distance\n\n# Code Block 14: Distance Between Home and Transaction\n\n# I believe this assuming a spherical Earth\n\n# convert to radians\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  mutate(\n    lat1_radians = lat_home / 57.29577951,\n    lat2_radians = lat_trans / 57.29577951,\n    long1_radians = long_home / 57.29577951,\n    long2_radians = long_trans / 57.29577951\n  )\n\n# calculating distance\nfraud <-\n  fraud %>% mutate(distance_miles = 3963.0 * acos((sin(lat1_radians) * sin(lat2_radians)) + cos(lat1_radians) * cos(lat2_radians) * cos(long2_radians - long1_radians)\n  ))\n\n# calculating the correlation\nfraud_distance <- round(cor(fraud$distance_miles, fraud$is_fraud), 3) \n\nDespite my assumption that distance would be correlated with fraud, the correlation value is quite low, -0.003.\nI’m going to visualize it anyway.\n\n# Code Block 15: Distance from Home and Fraud\nggplot(fraud, aes(distance_miles, is_fraud , fill = factor(is_fraud))) +\n  geom_point(\n    alpha = 1,\n    shape = 21,\n    colour = \"black\",\n    size = 5,\n    position = \"jitter\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    discrete = TRUE,\n    labels = c('Not Fraud', 'Fraud'),\n    name = \"\"\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Figure 5: How far from home does fraud occur?\") +\n  xlab(\"Distance from Home (miles)\") +\n  ylab(\"Is Fraud?\") \n\n\n\n\nSome distances only have fraudulent transactions. This might be related to the locations that are only fraud, Figure 4.\nThis new feature distances_miles is retained, and the original variables (city, state) and the intermediate variables (address, variables used to calculate distance) are removed in Code Block 16.\n\n# Code Block 16: Remove Extraneous/Temp Variables\n\n# created to calculate distance\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  select(-lat1_radians,-lat2_radians,-long1_radians,-long2_radians)\n\n#remove city and state and address, replaced by lat/long\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  select(-city, -state, -address)"

There are a few thousand 17-year-olds, which is too young to have their own credit card, but it is plausible that they would be an authorized user on their parents’ card. age seems a more reasonable variable than dob, so dob is also dropped from the dataset. For example, scammers might be more likely to target 90-year-olds. The age is the feature that leads to them being targeted, not the birth year. The birth year is related to age through the current date- in 10 years, a new cohort of birth years would be targeted if age is the important feature. So the age feature is more robust to passing time than dob.\n\n# Code Block 18: Removing dob\n\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  select(-dob)"

Looking at the date-times\ndate-time\ntrans_date_trans_time, Transaction DateTime\nQuestions\nWould processing the date-times yield more useful predictors?\nFirst, I want to look at variation in the number of transactions with date-time. I chose to use a histogram with bins corresponding to one month widths.\n\n# Code Block 19: Looking at Transaction Date/ Times\n\nggplot(fraud, aes(trans_date_trans_time)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"darkcyan\",\n                 fill = \"darkcyan\",\n                 bins = 24) + #24 months in dataset\n  ggtitle(\"Figure 7: When do Transactions occur\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  xlab(\"Date/ Time\")\n\n\n\n\nNext, I will break the transaction date-time into day of the week, hour, and the date only. I’m doing this here with lubridate functions, but I could also do this in the model building section, when I create recipes by using step_date(). I will also graph transactions by day of the week.\n\n# Code Block 20: \n\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  mutate(\n    date_only = date(trans_date_trans_time),\n    hour = hour(trans_date_trans_time),\n    weekday = wday(trans_date_trans_time)\n  )\n\nggplot(fraud, aes(weekday)) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    color = \"darkcyan\",\n    fill = \"darkcyan\",\n    binwidth = 1,\n    center = 0.5\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Figure 7: On what days do transactions occur?\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  xlab(\"Weekday\")\n\n\n\n\nMonday has the highest number of transactions; this could be due to businesses processing orders that came in over the weekend. By default, lubridate codes the day of the week as a number where 1 means Monday, 7 means Sunday.\nNow, I look at what time of day do most transactions occur?\n\n# Code Block 21: What time do transactions occur\nfig_8a <- ggplot(fraud, aes(hour)) +\n  geom_boxplot(color = \"darkcyan\") +\n  #ggtitle(\"What hour do transactions occur\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  xlab(\"Hour\")\n\n\nfig_8b <- ggplot(fraud, aes(hour)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"darkcyan\") +\n  #ggtitle(\"What hour do transactions occur\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  xlab(\"Hour\") \n\nplot_fig_8 <- plot_grid(fig_8a, fig_8b, labels = c('A', 'B'))\n\ntitle_8 <- ggdraw() +\n  draw_label(\n    \"Figure 8.

I might expect that most transactions would occur during normal business hours (~9-5) or more occur during lunch or after work, but what we see is a lower number of transactions from midnight to ~ 2 pm and then a higher number of transactions from 2 pm until midnight. The odd pattern could be a sign that something is wrong with the data (perhaps timezones aren’t being encoded properly?), or it could be simply a lack of subject matter knowledge (for example, transactions are pre-authorized at the time of sale and processed later, and the transaction time is the processing time, not the sale time.) Of course, this is also a synthetic dataset, so this pattern may be simply the result of user input choices when the set was generated. If this were a real dataset, I’d chase this down.\nAnd I made a table too, just to look at this data in another way.\n\n# Code Block 22:\ntable_5_data <- fraud %>% count(hour)\n\ntable_5 <- table_5_data %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  tab_header(title = \"Transactions by Time of Day\") %>%\n  cols_label(hour = \"Hour\", n = \"Count\") %>%\n  opt_stylize(style = 1,\n              color = \"green\",\n              add_row_striping = TRUE)\ngt:::as.tags.gt_tbl(table_5)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Transactions by Time of Day\n    \n    \n    \n      Hour\n      Count\n    \n  \n  \n    0\n11039\n    1\n11241\n    2\n11019\n    3\n11227\n    4\n10904\n    5\n11023\n    6\n11145\n    7\n11094\n    8\n11123\n    9\n10997\n    10\n11123\n    11\n11016\n    12\n17168\n    13\n17125\n    14\n16879\n    15\n17169\n    16\n17465\n    17\n17011\n    18\n17021\n    19\n17277\n    20\n17298\n    21\n17267\n    22\n17460\n    23\n17516\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nStill weird.\nI discard the original variable and keep the new variables.\n\n# Code Block 23:\n#removing the original variable and keeping the component variables.\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  select(-trans_date_trans_time)"

I remove some variables that I don’t think will impact fraud- the population of the home city and the location of the home. I don’t think the home should have an impact on fraud; it is where the card is used, not where it is billed, that should matter. I suppose you could have a neighborhood where all the mail was being stolen, and cards were compromised that way, but I think most cards get compromised at the point of sale.\nI also removed the date. The date itself is unlikely to be related to fraud. It is possible that special dates are correlated with fraud, like a holiday or a big sports match. Engineering a holiday feature could be a future improvement.\nThere is a possibility that job type could have an impact on fraud; for example, a trucker might be more likely to have his/her card stolen just because they are always on the road and visiting a wide variety of places where they would use the card. Or this could come in as an interaction term with distance; distance from home and the occupation trucker might have no correlation, but the distance from home and the occupation teacher might have because it would be a more unusual event for that job. However, some model fitting fails to converge when job is included, and it takes a long time for the models that it does work for. So I remove it too.\n\n# Code Block 26:\n# removed in related clusters, so easy to comment out if you want to add back a group\n\n# remove amt and keep log transformed version\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  select(-amt)\n\n# home location and home city pop shouldn't impact fraud\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  select(-city_pop,-lat_home,-long_home)\n\n# remove date\nfraud <- fraud %>% select(-date_only)\n\n# remove jobs\nfraud <- fraud %>%\n  select(-job)"

Creating recipes\nNext, I create recipes that do preprocessing of the data- making dummy variables, normalizing, and removing variables that only contain one value (step_zv(all_predictors())). The processing will be applied to both the training and testing data as you move through the workflow.\nI used the chart found in Appendix A of the Tidy Modeling with R by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge to choose the preprocessing of data. Some models require specific types of preprocessing, others don’t require it, but it can produce better or faster fitting, and in other cases, the preprocessing isn’t required and probably doesn’t help. The chart breaks this down for each category of preprocessing model by model. The same preprocessing steps were required or recommended for the models I chose, so I used them across the board. You can create recipes for different models and build a workflow manually to match the models to the proper recipe. This process is covered extensively in Chapter 15 of Tidy Modeling with R.\nI use the selector functions (all_nominal_predictors(), all_numerical_predictors(), etc.) available in the tidymodels framework. A listing of all selector functions usable in tidymodels can be found here. Using selector functions when handling groups of features reduces the chance of mistakes and typos.\nI then modify this recipe to handle the imbalanced class problem. I use SMOTE and ROSE hybrid methods to balance the classes. These methods create synthetic data for the minority class and downsample the majority class to balance the classes. I also use downsample, which throws away majority class records to balance the two classes. A good overview is here, and it also provides a tutorial for handling this type of problem with caret, rather than tidymodels.

Similarly, 6 grids points is a very low number.\n\n# Code block 35: \nset.seed(345)\ntune_results <-\n  workflow_map(\n    wf_set_tune,\n    \"tune_grid\",\n    resamples = fraud_folds,\n    grid = 6,\n    metrics = fraud_metrics,\n    verbose = TRUE\n    )\n\ni  1 of 16 tuning:     plain_glmnet\n\n\n✔  1 of 16 tuning:     plain_glmnet (2m 28.3s)\n\n\ni  2 of 16 tuning:     plain_lightgmb\n\n\ni Creating pre-processing data to finalize unknown parameter: mtry\n\n\n✔  2 of 16 tuning:     plain_lightgmb (4m 58.1s)\n\n\ni   No tuning parameters. `fit_resamples()` will be attempted\n\n\ni  3 of 16 resampling: plain_rf\n\n\n✔  3 of 16 resampling: plain_rf (51.7s)\n\n\ni   No tuning parameters. `fit_resamples()` will be attempted\n\n\ni  4 of 16 resampling: plain_logreg\n\n\n✔  4 of 16 resampling: plain_logreg (9.9s)\n\n\ni  5 of 16 tuning:     rose_glmnet\n\n\n✔  5 of 16 tuning:     rose_glmnet (4m 1.2s)\n\n\ni  6 of 16 tuning:     rose_lightgmb\n\n\ni Creating pre-processing data to finalize unknown parameter: mtry\n\n\n✔  6 of 16 tuning:     rose_lightgmb (11m 46s)\n\n\ni   No tuning parameters. `fit_resamples()` will be attempted\n\n\ni  7 of 16 resampling: rose_rf\n\n\n✔  7 of 16 resampling: rose_rf (24m 23.1s)\n\n\ni   No tuning parameters. `fit_resamples()` will be attempted\n\n\ni  8 of 16 resampling: rose_logreg\n\n\n✔  8 of 16 resampling: rose_logreg (18.1s)\n\n\ni  9 of 16 tuning:     smote_glmnet\n\n\n✔  9 of 16 tuning:     smote_glmnet (5m 45.1s)\n\n\ni 10 of 16 tuning:     smote_lightgmb\n\n\ni Creating pre-processing data to finalize unknown parameter: mtry\n\n\n✔ 10 of 16 tuning:     smote_lightgmb (7m 24.4s)\n\n\ni   No tuning parameters. `fit_resamples()` will be attempted\n\n\ni 11 of 16 resampling: smote_rf\n\n\n✔ 11 of 16 resampling: smote_rf (2m 41.2s)\n\n\ni   No tuning parameters. `fit_resamples()` will be attempted\n\n\ni 12 of 16 resampling: smote_logreg\n\n\n✔ 12 of 16 resampling: smote_logreg (12.4s)\n\n\ni 13 of 16 tuning:     down_glmnet\n\n\n✔ 13 of 16 tuning:     down_glmnet (9.9s)\n\n\ni 14 of 16 tuning:     down_lightgmb\n\n\ni Creating pre-processing data to finalize unknown parameter: mtry\n\n\n✔ 14 of 16 tuning:     down_lightgmb (2m 25.6s)\n\n\ni   No tuning parameters. `fit_resamples()` will be attempted\n\n\ni 15 of 16 resampling: down_rf\n\n\n✔ 15 of 16 resampling: down_rf (8.4s)\n\n\ni   No tuning parameters. `fit_resamples()` will be attempted\n\n\ni 16 of 16 resampling: down_logreg\n\n\n✔ 16 of 16 resampling: down_logreg (2.7s)"

    "text": "7.7. Evaluating the models\nI viewed the results of the fitting as both a table and graphically using autoplot(). The default autoplot legend is unclear, so you’ll want to do both, as I did. The legend doesn’t label by recipe (only that a recipe was used for preprocessing) and folds related categories into one. Here you see that elastic net logistic regression and logistic regression are both labeled log_reg.\nThe object we have now, tune_results, is incredibly large and complicated. Using View() on it has crashed RStudio for me. This object should be interacted with through helper functions. For more information about this, please see my other tutorial on tidymodels.\n\n#|label: rank-results-table\n# Code Block 35\nrank_results(tune_results, rank_metric = \"j_index\")\n\n# A tibble: 280 × 9\n   wflow_id       .config   .metric  mean std_err     n preprocessor model  rank\n   <chr>          <chr>     <chr>   <dbl>   <dbl> <int> <chr>        <chr> <int>\n 1 down_lightgmb  Preproce… accura… 0.957 0.00240     3 recipe       boos…     1\n 2 down_lightgmb  Preproce… j_index 0.915 0.00483     3 recipe       boos…     1\n 3 down_lightgmb  Preproce… roc_auc 0.992 0.00100     3 recipe       boos…     1\n 4 down_lightgmb  Preproce… sensit… 0.959 0.00407     3 recipe       boos…     1\n 5 down_lightgmb  Preproce… specif… 0.956 0.00241     3 recipe       boos…     1\n 6 smote_lightgmb Preproce… accura… 0.967 0.00170     3 recipe       boos…     2\n 7 smote_lightgmb Preproce… j_index 0.915 0.00310     3 recipe       boos…     2\n 8 smote_lightgmb Preproce… roc_auc 0.990 0.00102     3 recipe       boos…     2\n 9 smote_lightgmb Preproce… sensit… 0.948 0.00399     3 recipe       boos…     2\n10 smote_lightgmb Preproce… specif… 0.967 0.00172     3 recipe       boos…     2\n# ℹ 270 more rows\n\n\n\n# Code Block 36\nautoplot(tune_results, rank_metric = \"j_index\", select_best = TRUE) +\n  ggtitle(\"Figure 11: Performance of various models\")\n\n\n\n\nThe best performing model / recipe pair by j-index is the downsampled lightgmb (down_lightgmb).\nTo see how this model/recipe performs across tuning parameters, we can use extract_workflow_set_result and autoplot. If you wanted to refine the hyperparameters more, you could use these results to narrow the search parameters to areas with the best performance.\n\n# Code block 37: \n\nresults_down_gmb <- tune_results %>%\n  extract_workflow_set_result(\"down_lightgmb\")\nautoplot(results_down_gmb) +\n  theme_pander(8) +\n  ggtitle(\"Figure 12: Perfomance of different hyperparameters\")\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, I’m just going to extract the best set of hyperparameters and move on. This is done using the extract_workflow_set_result and select_best(metric = \"j_index\"). There are other ways to select the best hyperparameters. The list of selectors is found here.\n\n# Code block 38: \nbest_hyperparameters <- tune_results %>%\n  extract_workflow_set_result(\"down_lightgmb\") %>%\n  select_best(metric = \"j_index\")\n\nAnd here I look at the selected hyperparameters.\n\n# Code block 39: \nprint(best_hyperparameters)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n   mtry trees min_n tree_depth learn_rate loss_reduction .config             \n  <int> <int> <int>      <int>      <dbl>          <dbl> <chr>               \n1    19  1679    35         15     0.0279        0.00249 Preprocessor1_Model6\n\n\nNow, I am going to use the convenience functions finalize_workflow() and last_fit() to add the best hyperparameters to the workflow, train the model/recipe on the entire training set, and then predict on the entire test set. There is a lot of stuff going on here at once (Code Block 40)!\n\n# Code Block 40: Validating the model with the test data\nvalidation_results <- tune_results %>%\n  extract_workflow(\"down_lightgmb\") %>%\n  finalize_workflow(best_hyperparameters) %>%\n  last_fit(split =  data_split, metrics = fraud_metrics)\n\nLastly, I look at the metrics and ROC curve for the test data.\n\n# Code Block 41: Looking at the validation metrics from the test data.\ncollect_metrics(validation_results)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  .metric     .estimator .estimate .config             \n  <chr>       <chr>          <dbl> <chr>               \n1 accuracy    binary         0.962 Preprocessor1_Model1\n2 sensitivity binary         0.950 Preprocessor1_Model1\n3 specificity binary         0.963 Preprocessor1_Model1\n4 j_index     binary         0.912 Preprocessor1_Model1\n5 roc_auc     binary         0.992 Preprocessor1_Model1\n\nvalidation_results %>%\n  collect_predictions() %>%\n  roc_curve(is_fraud, .pred_1) %>%\n  autoplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Figure 13: ROC Curve\")\n\n\n\n\nJust for fun, let’s see how much money this model would have save our credit card company. I’m going to assume the cost of fraud is the cost of the transaction. I calculate the total cost of all the fraudulent transactions in the test dataset. I then calculate the cost based on the model predictions. Any truly fraudulent transactions that were not caught, cost the value of the transaction. Legitimate transactions that were marked as fraud were assigned $0 cost. This likely isn’t true. There is the cost of having to deal with customers calling because the transaction was declined or the cost sending out texts for suspicious transactions, but this cost is very small relative to the cost of a fraudulent transaction. I got the idea from this paper: Zhang, D. , Bhandari, B. and Black, D. (2020) Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Weighted Support Vector Machine. Applied Mathematics, 11, 1275-1291. doi: 10.4236/am.2020.1112087.\nI’m using the list method to access predictions, but you could also use collect_predictions().\n\n#code block 42: Calculating how much fraud cost the company\n\nval <- validation_results[[5]][[1]]\n\nval %>% conf_mat(truth = is_fraud, estimate = .pred_class)\n\n          Truth\nPrediction     1     0\n         1   435  3161\n         0    23 81283\n\nval <-\n  #I'm going to bind this to the test data and I want unique names\n  val %>% rename(is_fraud2  = is_fraud) \n\ncost <- test_data %>%\n  cbind(val)\n\ncost <- cost %>%\n  select(is_fraud, amt_log, pred = .pred_class, is_fraud2) \n\ncost <- cost %>%\n  #cost for missing fraud in prediction\n  mutate(cost_act = ifelse((is_fraud == 1 &\n                              pred == 0), amt_log, 0)) %>%\n  #cost of all fraud\n  mutate(cost_potential = ifelse((is_fraud == 1), amt_log, 0))\n\nmissed_fraud_cost <- round(sum(exp(cost$cost_act)), 2)\nall_fraud_cost <- round(sum(exp(cost$cost_potential)), 2)\n\nsavings <- 100 * round((sum(exp(cost$cost_act)) / sum(exp(cost$cost_potential))), 2)\n\nMy model had dramatic costs savings for the imaginary credit card company! The losses from the model were 27 % of the potential losses."
