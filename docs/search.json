While I did a lot of coding and modeling as a chemist, I did not formally learn to code or about modeling and machine learning frameworks. (I wish I had! My post-doc would have been a lot smoother.)\nMost of my academic work was in Matlab so I chose to start this process with R because it looked more similar than Python."

    "text": "This is my first blog entry. I am following the tutorials here:\nhttps://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/#where-you-should-start-changing-stuff\nhttps://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/\nGenerally, this process has been a nightmare. The website is being created within RStudio, then pushed to GitHub and published through GitHub pages. As I’ve made changes per the tutorial, I have repeatedly been unable to push changes to GitHub due to a variety of fatal errors and merge conflicts. Since I’m only working in a single place I have no idea where all these merge conflicts are arising from. I don’t understand how I can have everything in sync everywhere, make a local change, commit it, and then be unable to push it. I’ve had to delete the GitHub repository at least half a dozen times and recreate it from my local version because I couldn’t find any way to fix the conflicts and fatal errors. I’m not sure whose fault this is (Quarto, GitHub or RStudio). It could be my fault, but I really don’t understand why things are breaking so spectacularly. I’ve used git/ GitHub for version control of R projects before and I’ve never had an error. (I don’t really see how you can get a merge conflict if you are the only person working on a project and you are only working at a single location, but maybe I’m failing to envision some use case.)\nI decided to go with Quarto because it is now built-in to RStudio and the tutorials by Samantha Csik seemed very clear. (And to be fair, they are! Very easy to follow.) The tutorials I found for R Markdown to make a website seemed a little more involved and a little more kludgey.\nCouldn’t have done it without the best helper turtle in the world. Mac took a lot of executive naps to work on the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{e.sinks2023,\n  author = {Louise E.
