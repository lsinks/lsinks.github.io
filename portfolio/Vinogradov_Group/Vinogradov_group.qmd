## Developing New Microscopy Techniques

The [Vinogradov Lab](https://vinogradovlab.org/) at the University of Pennsylvania is a multi-disciplinary group that develops new molecules and instrumentation for analyte detection and imaging. My work focused on developing a new two-photon lifetime imaging microscopy technique for quantifying cell oxygen content.

I coupled ultrafast laser spectroscopy techniques with two-photon microscopy to create a novel phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscope. This method allows the optical sectioning of 3D samples while also obtaining information about the local chemical environment. Phosphorescent molecules glow more or less intensely based on the amount of oxygen in the area, so they can be used to measure local oxygen concentrations. Others in the group synthesized these novel molecules, and then I validated their performance for imaging.

In photophysics, models for various processes have often been derived mathematically from fundamental principles or experimentally validated in other systems. Fitting the data then becomes simpler since you only have to fit against a few equations. However, fitting parameters are related to the intrinsic properties of molecules and materials, so it is vital to ensure you are fitting with the correct model. Sometimes, a poorer fit to a more scientifically defensible model is more correct than a better fit to an invalid model. Lots of cross-checking and additional experimentation are needed beyond just fitting.

In addition to deriving photophysical constants, I used the parameters as inputs to simulate the optical resolution of the new microscopy technique.
