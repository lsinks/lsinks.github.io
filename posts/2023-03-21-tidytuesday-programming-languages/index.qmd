title: "TidyTuesday: Programming Languages"
---

This is my first attempt at Tidy Tuesday. The dataset today is about Programming Languages. The sample visualizations are about the comment codes.

```{r}
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

```{r}
# Get the Data

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 
# Install from CRAN via: install.packages("tidytuesdayR")
# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-03-21')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 12)

languages2 <- tuesdata$languages

# Or read in the data manually

#languages <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com#/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-03-21/languages.csv')
```

```{r}


```

Let's try to reproduce the graphs in the sample article first.
