It is Day 3 of the #30DayChartChallenge. More info can be found at the [challenge's Github page](https://github.com/30DayChartChallenge/Edition2023). Today's theme is flora and fauna. I found a trove of fascinating data at [Global Assessment of Reptile Distributions](http://www.gardinitiative.org/data.html). I chose the dataset on body size/ mass from the paper: ["Different solutions lead to similar life history traits across the great divides of the amniote tree of life." by Shai Meiri, Gopal Murali, Anna Zimin, Lior Shak, Yuval Itescu, Gabriel Caetano, and Uri Roll (Journal of Biological Research-Thessaloniki), 202128: 3](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40709-021-00134-9).

Okay, let's go. I'm going to keep the libraries to a minimum.

```{r}
#| label: loading-libraries
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(gt)
library(ggthemes)
library(cowplot)
library(magick)
```

```{r}
#| label: loading-data
#| warning: false

fauna <- read_csv("animals.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

```

I'm going to change the class, clade, order, family and bionomial_2020 to factors. I'm keeping those columns and the mass and discarding the rest.

```{r}
#| label: clean-data

fauna_cleaned <- fauna %>%
  select(Class:`body mass (g)`) %>%
  select(-`binomial_(original files)`) %>%
  rename(mass_g = `body mass (g)`, name = binomial_2020) %>%
  mutate(Class = factor(Class),
         Clade = factor(Clade),
         order = factor(order),
         family = factor(family),
         name = factor(name))

```

We have data on more than just reptiles, the dataset includes information about birds and mammals as well. But I'm only interested in reptiles.

```{r}
#| label: filtering-reptiles

reptiles <- fauna_cleaned %>%
  filter(Class == "Reptilia")
```

```{r}
#| label: reptile-order-table

table2 <- reptiles %>%
  count(Clade, order)

gt(table2)

```

Everyone knows that turtles are the best type of reptile, so let's filter even further.

```{r}

turtles <- reptiles %>% 
  filter(Clade == "Testudines")

table3 <- turtles %>%
  count(order, family)

gt(table3)
```

Let's take a look at how big (or mighty, as some might say) the different families of turtles are. There is a very large range of masses so I'm using a log scale.

```{r}
ggplot(turtles, aes(x = family, y = mass_g, color = family)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Mightiness of Different Families of Turtle and Tortoise") +
  ylab("mass (g)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none" , 
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Ollie Burger fun.

```{r}
#| label: box-turtle-fun

eurasian_pond_turtles <- turtles %>%
  filter(family == 'Geoemydidae') %>%
  mutate(reeves_turtle = ifelse(name == "Mauremys reevesii", TRUE, FALSE)) 
```

Okay, let's look at mightiness of the turtles in this family.

```{r}
turtle_plot_ollie <- eurasian_pond_turtles %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(name, mass_g), y = mass_g, fill = reeves_turtle)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#999999", "darkgreen")) +
  geom_col(width = 0.7, position = position_dodge(10)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 285, color = "darkgreen", linetype = "dotted") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  coord_flip() +
  ylab("mass (g)") +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Mightiness of Different Turtles in family Geoemydidae") +
  labs(subtitle = "Ollie Burger Mightiness: https://twitter.com/pthelo/",
         caption = "Data from https://doi.org/10.1186/s40709-021-00134-9") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 4)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# Set the canvas where you are going to draw the plot and the image
