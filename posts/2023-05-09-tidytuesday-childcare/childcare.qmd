Today's TidyTuesday is about childcare prices.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(skimr)
```

Loading the data in the usual way.

```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 19)

childcare_costs <- tuesdata$childcare_costs
counties <- tuesdata$counties
```

There are two data files. The dataframe counties has information about county and state, while childcare_costs has a variety of economic data for each county over several years (2008 - 2018). The two dataframes can be joined on county_fips_code, which is a unique identifier for every county. If you look at the TidyTuesday notes, they actually started out in a single file and were split up.

```{r}
labor_rates <- childcare_costs %>%
  select(study_year, county_fips_code, flfpr_20to64, flfpr_20to64_under6, mc_infant, mfcc_infant )
```

```{r}
labor_rates_2 <- labor_rates %>%
  left_join(counties)
```

```{r}
#| column: page

my_skim <- skim_with(numeric = sfl(p25 = NULL, p50 = NULL, p75 = NULL)) 

my_skim(labor_rates_2)
```

Employment gap between all women and women with young children

```{r}
labor_rates_2 <- labor_rates_2 %>%
  mutate(gap = flfpr_20to64 - flfpr_20to64_under6)
```

average cost of infant care

```{r}
labor_rates_2 <- labor_rates_2 %>%
  mutate(cost = (mc_infant + mfcc_infant)/2)
```

plot gap vs. cost for 2018

```{r}
labor_rates_2 %>%
 # filter(study_year == 2018) %>%
  ggplot(aes(cost, gap, color = study_year)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

correlation

```{r}

labor_rates_2_2018 <- labor_rates_2 %>%
 filter(study_year == 2018)
cor(labor_rates_2_2018$gap, labor_rates_2_2018$cost, use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

```
