[This week's TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-03-28/readme.md) is about the timezone data from [IANA timezone database](https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html).

```{r}

#| warning: false
#| output: false
library(tidytuesdayR)
library(tidyverse)

library(sf)
library(ggimage)

```

The history of this database is fascinating. It is used by many computer systems to determine the correct time based on location. To learn more, I recommend reading [Daniel Rosehill's article on the topic](https://onezero.medium.com/the-largely-untold-story-of-how-one-guy-in-california-keeps-the-worlds-computers-on-the-right-time-a97a5493bf73). For a drier history, check out the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database).

```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| warning: false
#| output: false
# Get the Data

# Read in with tidytuesdayR package 
# This loads the readme and all the datasets for the week of interest

# Either ISO-8601 date or year/week works!

#tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-03-21')
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 13)

transitions <- tuesdata$transitions
timezones <- tuesdata$timezones
timezone_countries <- tuesdata$timezone_countries
countries <- tuesdata$countries
```

It is suggested that we change the begin and end variables in transitions to datetimes.

```{r}
#| label: cleaning-data
#| warning: false
#| output: false
transitions <- transitions %>%
  mutate(begin = as_datetime(begin), end = as_datetime(end))


```

I was interested in how many countries had multiple times zones. I know the US has 4 time zones in the continental US.

```{r}
#| label: how-many-tz
#| warning: false

num_zones <- timezone_countries %>%
  count(country_code, sort = TRUE)

num_zones %>% 
  filter(n > 1) %>%
  left_join(countries) %>%
  select(place_name, n) %>%
  filter(place_name != "NA") %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(place_name = "Country", n = "Number of TZs") %>%
  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = "blue", add_row_striping = TRUE) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Countries with Multiple TZs") 


```

And we find that the United States has 29!! time zones in the database. This was unexpected, so say the least. I thought maybe there were some times zones for territories and perhaps military bases that I did not know about. I also thought there might be some extra time zones arising from some states using daylight savings time, while others in the same area might not. I wanted to visualize where these times zones were.

```{r}
US_tz <- timezone_countries %>% 
  filter(country_code == "US") %>%
  left_join(timezones)
```

I found the [lutz package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lutz/) created nice pictograms about when a timezone shifts from DST and back. (This package uses the same underlying database that we are using here to determine when the shifts occur.)

```{r}
 tz_plot(US_tz$zone[21])

```

I created the plots and saved them as images. I modified a function I found on [stack overflow to create the file names](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66324232/how-to-save-files-with-different-names-using-for-loops-in-r).

```{r}

wd <- getwd()
filepath = file.path(wd)


make_filename = function(number){
  # doing this, putting it all on a single line or using pipe %>%
  # is just matter of style
  filename = paste("tzplot", number, sep="_")
  filename = paste0(filename, ".png")
  filename = file.path(filepath, filename)
  
  filename
}

#creating a variable to store the files name
US_tz <- US_tz %>%
  mutate(image_name = "tbd")

index <- 1
for (index in seq(1, nrow(US_tz))) {
  filename = make_filename(index)
  US_tz[index , "image_name"] <- filename
  # 1. Open jpeg file
  png(filename, width = 350, height = 350, bg = "transparent")
  # 2. Create the plot
  # you need to print the plot if you call it inside a loop
  print(tz_plot(US_tz$zone[index]))
  # 3. Close the file
  dev.off()
  index = index + 1
}

```

Next I created a world map, inspired by the one from

I hadn't previously used the [maps package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/), so I appreciate being introduced to it. The maps package only has a mainland US map, so I used the world map. (Plus, as I mentioned, I thought some of these time zones would be in other parts of the world.) I followed a tutorial on [Plotting Points as Images in ggplot](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-10-11-embedding-images-in-ggplot/) and used the hints about aspect ratio to make my tz_plot circles remain circular. However, that did stretch the world a bit.

```{r}

aspect_ratio <- 1.618  

us_tz_map <- map_data("world") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(long, lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group), fill = "white", 
               color = "gray30", alpha = 0.9) +
  geom_image(aes(x = longitude, latitude, image = image_name), 
             data = US_tz, size = 0.025, by = "width",
             asp = aspect_ratio) +
  coord_sf() +
  labs(title = "The United States has 29 Timezone- Mostly Redunant",
       caption = "Data from: https://data.iana.org/time-zones/tz-link.html") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1/aspect_ratio,
    legend.position = "bottom",
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white")
    )

ggsave("thumbnail.png", us_tz_map, width = 5 * aspect_ratio, height = 5)
us_tz_map
```

And what we see is there are a bunch of redundant times zone specification, especially in the Midwest.

```{r}
US_tz %>%
  select(zone, latitude, longitude) %>%
  arrange(longitude) %>%
  gt() %>%
  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = "blue", add_row_striping = TRUE) %>%
  tab_header(title = "Countries with Multiple TZs") 

```
