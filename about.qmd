I am a Physical Chemist with over ten years of experience working in multidisciplinary teams in various fields. I am a highly experienced writer and have published numerous peer-reviewed articles and papers on these topics. I previously ran the day-to-day operations of a small nanotechnology start-up.

More details about my background below if you are interested.


**EDUCATION**

University of Pennsylvania 2005-2011

Prof. Sergei A. Vinogradov U. of Pennsylvania 2008-2011

Postdoctoral Research Fellow

Developed new two-photon lifetime imaging microscopy technique for quantifying oxygen content in cells. Validated and characterized new fluorescent or phosphorescent probes for oxygen, zinc, and pH sensing. Performed cell culture work to maintain cells used in microscopy. Performed various assays to determine the viability of cells doped with the probe molecules.

Center for Oxygen Microscopic Imaging University of Aarhus July-August 2009

Visiting Researcher

Tested cytotoxic effects of fluorescent probes developed in Vinogradov lab. Performed singlet oxygen microscopy. Learned and performed patch-clamp technique (whole-cell electrophysiological measurements) to study the effect of localized reactive oxygen species generation on ion channel function in mouse neurons.

Prof. R. Hochstrasser & Prof. M. J. Therien U. of Pennsylvania 2005- 2008

NIH National Research Service Award Postdoctoral Fellow

Used 2D-IR techniques to probe the local structure of trans-membrane proteins and Vis-pump/ IR-probe ultra-fast techniques to probe proton-coupled electron transfer.

Prof. M. J. Therien & Prof. R. Hochstrasser U. of Pennsylvania 2004- 2005

Postdoctoral Research Fellow Utilized IR- pump/ probe, VIS- pump/probe, and Vis-pump/ IR-probe ultra-fast techniques to study the influence of environment on biologically relevant processes such as proton-coupled electron transfer. Environments ranged from simple solvents to complex protein hosts. Use visible pump-probe techniques to study highly conjugated porphyrin arrays. Built VIS-pump/IR-probe equipment.

Northwestern University Evanston, IL 1999-2004

2001-2004 PhD in Chemistry

● Dissertation Title: Role of Environment on Photo-induced Electron Transfer

1999- 2001 MS in Chemistry

● Thesis Title: Photo-induced Electron Transfer of Donor-Acceptor Molecules in a Liquid Crystalline Environment

Prof. M. R. Wasielewski Northwestern University 1999- 2004

Graduate Research Assistant/ Teaching Assistant Researched solvent/media effects on photo-induced electron transfer in organic covalent donor-acceptor systems as well as the role of conformational gating on electronic coupling of donors and acceptors. Studied impact on π- π driven self-assembly on electron and energy transfer within the nanostructure. Designed, constructed, and maintained two femtosecond transient absorption laser systems. Synthesized donor-acceptor molecules.

University of Virginia Charlottesville, VA 1995 - 1999

● Echols Scholar (College of Arts and Sciences honors program)

● Major: BS in Chemistry with Honors, BA in Physics Minor: Math

**EMPLOYMENT**

US Nano LLC

Vice President 2012-2017

Ran the day to day operations. Key responsibilities:

Project Management

- Directed US Nano's research activities to develop semiconductor nanowire technologies
- Managed team of 5-10 technical and support staff
- Resulted in two US patents for scalable synthesis of nanowires, additional applications pending.
- Wrote and managed grants to fund portions of research
  - Awarded NSF SBIR Phase II grant for ~$747,000

Marketing & Business Development efforts

- Generated copy for white papers, company website, and other promotional materials
- Generated and presented pitches to Angels, VCs, and potential Industrial partners
- Interviewed 100 potential customers to understand needs around nanowire technology

Technical & Analytical Work

- Designed and Analyzed experiments using DOE (Design of Experiments) principles using specialized software (Stat-Ease) or advanced Excel functionality (Pivot tables or wrote custom VBA macros) over a wide range of areas (ink formulation, nanomaterial synthesis, and electrical device design)
- Developed financial models for various business models
- Implemented Statistical Process Control on key manufacturing activities to increase up-time

Senior Scientist 2011- 2012

Employee #1 of US Nano. Set-up company laboratory and offices in South Bend. Obtained funding through the National Science Foundation's Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program. Hired research team and managed daily operations. Performed research on nanowires synthesis and the application of nanowires to printed electronics.

Ford Motor Company Summers1998, 1999

Professional/Technical Trainee (Intern)

Contributed to the development of a more sensitive and durable pressure sensitive paint (PSP) for aerodynamic applications. Research resulted in two Ford confidential papers for internal circulation only and Ford filed invention disclosure papers on one of the polymer systems. Research consisted of development of appropriate polymer base, identification of chromophores with high sensing potential, and design and implementation of standards in manufacturing and performance to effectively evaluate PSPs. Assisted in automation of lab. Helped implement Pressure Sensitive Paint measurement technique in a Ford wind tunnel. Demonstrated the technology both internally and to collaborators from the USAF and Boeing in live wind tunnel tests.
