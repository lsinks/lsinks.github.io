Hello! I'm Louise Sinks. Welcome to my website. I'm a chemist by training, and I've spent my career designing, running, and analyzing a variety of types of experiments.

You'll find some of my projects for former employers in the [portfolio section](https://lsinks.github.io/portfolio.html). Most of my research was on advanced functional materials with novel photophysical properties. In addition to spectroscopy, I employed statistical learning/ fitting methods, as interpretability is of primary importance in the sciences. Of course, being in charge of the experimental design gives you a huge advantage if you are trying to develop an interpretable model, as you can make sure you thoroughly explore the relevant parameter space. Most of my modeling and simulation work was done in Matlab, which seems to be a more popular language in academia than in industry and business.

You'll also find [my blog](https://lsinks.github.io/posts.html), where I do small projects to master new languages (R and Python currently). These are generally written as tutorials; throughout my career, I've benefitted immensely from code chunks and explanations I've found online, so this is my way of paying it forward. The blog posts are written in Quarto, and the [raw .qmd files can be found in my GitHub repo](https://github.com/lsinks/lsinks.github.io/tree/main/posts). These can be downloaded and run in RStudio or another IDE that supports Quarto. The [current projects section](https://lsinks.github.io/currentprojects.html) includes upcoming topics for the blog.
