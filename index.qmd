Hello! I'm Louise Sinks.

I'm a chemist by training. My favorite part was always analysis and modeling. I've recently been learning R and Python, and this webpage is a place to document my data science journey. While I did a lot of coding and modeling as a chemist, I did not formally learn about modeling and machine learning frameworks. (I wish I had! My post-doc would have been a lot smoother.)
